try/except is a way to catch errors before they are shown to the user.

It allows you to do something about them instead of the program just crashing.

An example would be a ValueError after a user inputs letters when integers were expected.

A try/except could be used to reprompt the user instead of ending the entire program.

try/except blocks can also be useful for debugging.
