# poker-game-theory-lab

This is my long-term personal project to study poker strategy using probability, statistics, and game theory with Python.


Goals:
- Learn core probability and combinatorics using poker examples.
- Build simulations of simplified poker games.
- Experiment with game-theoretic concepts like Nash equilibrium and optimal strategies.
- Document my learning and progress over several years.
